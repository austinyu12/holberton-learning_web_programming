            <p style="font-size: 25px">Hello. My name is Austin and I am 16 years old. I am from San Francisco and currently live in San Francisco. Some subjects I am interested in are history, foreign language, and music.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 25px" style="font-size: 40px">Currently, I am attending George Washington High School as a rising senior. George Washington High School, colloquially known as, "Wash", is located in the Richmond District
           overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. Some important sites of the school include Wash House, the pizza parlour located on the same block as the school, and the murals in the lobby, comissioned by the Works Progress Administration
            and painted by Victor Arnautoff. What distinguishes our school from other schools is our marching band (the only other school that has a marching band is Burton). The school's colors are scarlet and gray, and our mascot is the eagle.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 25px">My goal for this project was to make a clean, website with a clear purpose and if possible, make it believable. In order to accomplish that, I determined that a humanitarian or environmental mission website would serve my purpose. I
        mimicked the styles of "4Ocean", a company that sells bracelets made of recycled ocean plastic, and "Vitality Air", a company that sells canned air to regions of poor air quality. Initially, my plan was to make a fake website for the
        "Sudan Meal Project" and make them appear credible, but I changed my mind. Instead, I decided that the purpose of my website would be selling dehydrated water using water from flooded regions of the Earth, purifying the water, and
        shipping to regions in drought or lack clean water.</p></div>
